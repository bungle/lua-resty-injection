# lua-resty-injection

LuaJIT FFI bindings to libinjection (https://github.com/client9/libinjection) â€” SQL / SQLI / XSS tokenizer parser analyzer.

## Synopsis

```lua
local injection = require "resty.injection"

-- Print version of libinjection
print(injection.version)

-- Testing SQL injection detection
print(injection.sql("test; DROP users;"))
print(injection.sql("test"))
print(injection.sql("test<script></script>"))

-- Testing Cross-Site Scripting injection detection
print(injection.xss("test; DROP users;"))
print(injection.xss("test"))
print(injection.xss("test<script></script>"))
```

The above would output something similar to this:

```
3.9.1
true	n;Tn;
false
false
false
false
true
```

*The second line contains fingerprint of the injection.*
